## Local Development 🤜🤛

  1. Clone this repo.
  2. I recommend you to use `yarn` but if you want to do this with `npm`, make
     sure `yarn.lock` is deleted.
  3. `cd` to repo folder and run `yarn`.
  4. Wait until packages are installed.
  5. Put your [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API KEY to
     `.env.template`.
  6. Rename `.env.template` to `.env.local` / `.env` ( its the same btw, just to
     differentiate between local development and production later ).
  7. Run `yarn dev`
  8. Open `http://localhost:3000` on your `$BROWSER` to view the development
     version of this app.
